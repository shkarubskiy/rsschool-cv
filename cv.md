### About Me

I am an engineer who loves engineering, technology and programming. And LEGO<br>

For the last 8 years I have been working as an engineer of automated control systems, namely "Smart Home" systems. It was a very interesting experience, but over time I realized that the results of my work are available only to those for whom this work is being done - a client who wants a "Smart Home".<br>

This prompted me to change my activity to frontend development - a direction whose results are potentially available to the whole world.<br>
