### About Me

I am an engineer who loves engineering, technology and programming. And LEGO<br>

For the last 8 years I have been working as an engineer of automated control systems, namely "Smart Home" systems. It was a very interesting experience, but over time I realized that the results of my work are available only to those for whom this work is being done - a client who wants a "Smart Home".<br>

This prompted me to change my activity to frontend development - a direction whose results are potentially available to the whole world.<br>

### Code example from CODEWARS

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.

```javascript
function solution(string) {
  let result = "";
  for (letter of string) {
    letter != letter.toUpperCase()
      ? (result += letter)
      : (result = result + " " + letter);
  }
  return result;
}
```
